Church Chats is a new service for churches, originally designed for Catholic churches in Orange Country, California. It automatically answers common questions for people who need assistance from the church. It gives useful information to church members about hours, events, and more! If the chatbot can't answer a question, it will connect the person to a real person who can help. Church Chats is easy to put on any church website and is much cheaper than using traditional phone operators. We want to help the people who attend churches.
